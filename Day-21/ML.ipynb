    "Machine Learning is a different way of solving problems compared to traditional programming. In traditional programming, the developer provides both the rules and the data, and the computer produces an output based strictly on those instructions. In contrast, in Machine Learning we provide the computer with data and expected outputs, and the system automatically discovers the underlying patterns and rules by itself. Instead of explicitly coding every condition, the model learns behavior from examples, which makes it useful for complex problems like image recognition, recommendation systems, and speech understanding where writing manual rules is impractical."
